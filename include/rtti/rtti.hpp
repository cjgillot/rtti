/*! \mainpage RTTI library

  This library creates a efficient replacement of default C++ RTTI.

  Using a ISO C++ construct, RTTI provides acc√®s to a unique integer per class in the hierarchy.
  For each class, its bases' ids are also exposed as a linked list. This feature
  allows dynamic introspection through the hierarchy.

  Note : ids are garanteed to be constructed when main() starts. Using those
    before entering main() results in udefined behaviour.
  
  See examples/ folder for examples using this library.
