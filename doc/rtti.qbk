[section:rtti The __rtti__ library]

The __rtti__ sublibrary is meant to provide
runtime reflexion to your C++ classes.
Namely, it will register to each class
a unique id and the set of its base classes.

[section Accessing the library]

In order to use the __rtti__ library, you need to include this file :

``
    #include "mmethod/rtti.hpp"
``

All code resides in the __rtti_ns__ namespace. So we will suppose having
issued the following using directive :

``
    using namespace __rtti_ns__;
``
