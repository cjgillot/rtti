== CacheTable - High performance hash map ==

CacheTable is a C++ template library that implements a very fast hash map 
container.

Its particularity, compared with std::hash_map and google::sparse_hash_map 
it's that it has a fixed size (you decide it when you create it) and a 
random item replacement policy: in case of an 'hash collision' the older 
item is 'discarded' and replaced with the new one.

This container is ideal for implementing caching system, when you want 
super fast item insertion and retrieval and you know 'a priori' the memory 
amount you want to dedicate. It is also possible to use it in conjunction 
to a 2nd level cache, passing discarded item to a slower and bigger container.

The interfaces of the containers are compatible with STL, and to get a 
glimpse you can check out the examples provided.
